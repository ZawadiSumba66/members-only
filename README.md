# THE MEMBERS ONLY PROJECT
  In this project, we configured an authentication for users where they can sign up if they are new users. They can then create a post which will be saved and displayed in the homepage. 
  A user can also log out and if so, will not be able to see the author of the post. This also applies to non-registered users.
  
## Getting started

- Clone the repo `https://github.com/ZawadiSumba66/members-only.git`
- `cd` into the members-only
- Run `git checkout -b members_only`
- Run `git pull origin members_only`
- Run `bundle install`
- Run `$ rails db:create` to create database
- Run `rails db:migrate` to get the schema


## Features
![screenshot](./app/assets/images/screenshot.jpg)

- Start the rails server by running
```rails s```
Visit `http://localhost:3000/`

#### Signing_Up
- Fill all the inputs required in the sign up form and submit to authenticate you as a valid user

#### Create a new Post
- Go to the create post link and create a new post which will be saved in the home page

#### Logging_out
- Once you log out you cannot be able to see the authors' names but you can only see the posts
